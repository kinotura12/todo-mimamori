  A. HISTORY OF THE SOFTWARE
  ==========================
  
  Python was created in the early 1990s by Guido van Rossum at Stichting
  Mathematisch Centrum (CWI, see http://www.cwi.nl) in the Netherlands
  as a successor of a language called ABC.  Guido remains Python's
  principal author, although it includes many contributions from others.
  
  In 1995, Guido continued his work on Python at the Corporation for
  National Research Initiatives (CNRI, see http://www.cnri.reston.va.us)
  in Reston, Virginia where he released several versions of the
  software.
  
  In May 2000, Guido and the Python core development team moved to
  BeOpen.com to form the BeOpen PythonLabs team.  In October of the same
  year, the PythonLabs team moved to Digital Creations, which became
  Zope Corporation.  In 2001, the Python Software Foundation (PSF, see
  https://www.python.org/psf/) was formed, a non-profit organization
  created specifically to own Python-related Intellectual Property.
  Zope Corporation was a sponsoring member of the PSF.
  
  All Python releases are Open Source (see http://www.opensource.org for
  the Open Source Definition).  Historically, most, but not all, Python
  releases have also been GPL-compatible; the table below summarizes
  the various releases.
  
      Release         Derived     Year        Owner       GPL-
                      from                                compatible? (1)
  
      0.9.0 thru 1.2              1991-1995   CWI         yes
      1.3 thru 1.5.2  1.2         1995-1999   CNRI        yes
      1.6             1.5.2       2000        CNRI        no
      2.0             1.6         2000        BeOpen.com  no
      1.6.1           1.6         2001        CNRI        yes (2)
      2.1             2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         no
      2.0.1           2.0+1.6.1   2001        PSF         yes
      2.1.1           2.1+2.0.1   2001        PSF         yes
      2.1.2           2.1.1       2002        PSF         yes
      2.1.3           2.1.2       2002        PSF         yes
      2.2 and above   2.1.1       2001-now    PSF         yes
  
  Footnotes:
  
  (1) GPL-compatible doesn't mean that we're distributing Python under
      the GPL.  All Python licenses, unlike the GPL, let you distribute
      a modified version without making your changes open source.  The
      GPL-compatible licenses make it possible to combine Python with
      other software that is released under the GPL; the others don't.
  
  (2) According to Richard Stallman, 1.6.1 is not GPL-compatible,
      because its license has a choice of law clause.  According to
      CNRI, however, Stallman's lawyer has told CNRI's lawyer that 1.6.1
      is "not incompatible" with the GPL.
  
  Thanks to the many outside volunteers who have worked under Guido's
  direction to make these releases possible.
